The description of Assign00 is given in the
file assign00.sml. If you are unclear about
what is asked of you to do in this assignment,
please make sure that you seek clarification
before proceeding.

### assign00-lib.sml

The functions in assign00-lib.sml are the ONLY functions that are
allowed for Assign00.

in assign00-lib.sml; if you want to use it, then you have to implement
it on you own. Your solution would not be accepted if you use
functions not mentioned in assign00-lib.sml without implementing them
on your own.
