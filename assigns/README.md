## Assignments

### Submission

- Step 1.
You need to submit a bubble sheet to indicate whether you have
correctly solved each problem in a given assignment.  For each
problem, please fill/blacken the corresponding circle containing 'A'
if and only if your solution passes the ENTIRE set of given tests for
the problem. Otherwise, please leave the circle untouched.

- Step 2.
Your sumbitted code must be uploaded from your OWN Github repository
created for this class. If you upload another student's work as your
own, you will receive a failing grade (F) for this class and also be
reported to the BU disciplinary committee that handles cases as such.

- Step 3.
You also need to include a file containing evidence of your solutions
passing certain given tests. An example of such a file can be found
[here](https://github.com/hwxi/CS320-2023-Spring/blob/main/assigns/00/Solution/assign00-testall.out).

### Grading

- Suppose that you fill/blacken a circle containing 'A'. Then you will
be given X points assigned to the corresponding problem. If it is
found upon further testing that your solution turns out to be
incorrect, you will lose the whole or some fraction of these X points.

- Suppose that you fill/blacken a circle containing 'A' but your
solution to the corresponding problem fails to pass one of the given
tests. Then you will not only lose any points gained for solving the
problem but also be deducted X points as a form of penalty, where X is
the number of points assigned to the problem.
